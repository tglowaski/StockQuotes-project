There is one requirements when the phone rotates: **1.** All state of the app should be preserved. If I press 'G' and a 'O' and rotate the phone, I should be able to press 'O' and 'G' to continue 'GOOG'. Likewise, the returned values should also be maintained. Error handling must be implemented when an illegal symbol is typed in (see screenshot). The example screenshot shows what will get you a B+/A-.
